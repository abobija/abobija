### Hi there :wave: nice to meet you. I'm Alija.

Welcome and thanks for coming by.

Here you can find many interesting and open-source repositories about electronics, home-automation, auto-industry, software ci-cd, testing-automation, solution architecturing and more. Many of those repos are linked with my [**YouTube**](https://youtube.com/AlijaBobija) channel where I, from time to time, publish my projects and useful tutorials.

For more about me, as well as contact informations, please visit [abobija.com](https://abobija.com).
